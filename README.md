# AIIoTShield
A powerful network, vulnerability tool focused on IOT devices like IPCCTV cameras!
# IoTShield

IoTShield is an application that automatically detects and identifies all LAN/WAN network devices, including IoT, IP CCTV cameras, routers, IP telephones, wireless mobiles, Amazon Echo devices, Apple Not devices, and any wireless devices that could be vulnerable to outside hackers.

## Features

- Automatically detect and identify network devices
- Display device information in a clear and concise GUI
- Monitor real-time bi-directional byte average rates
- Utilize clustering and anomaly detection machine learning algorithms to learn normal network behavior and identify anomalies or security threats

## GUI

The GUI clearly displays all devices with their relevant detected device type icon image (hard-coded images) in an expanding grid fashion, along with:

- IP Address
- Device Name
- Device Type
- Device Software/Firmware Version Number
- MAC Address
- CPU Data
- Memory Data
- Other relevant information

## Device Norm

IoTShield records and understands a device's normal real-time bi-directional byte average rate, which is displayed as 'Device Norm'. If the application identifies any device outside of its 'normal' real-time bi-directional byte average rate, it reports it on the main GUI.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

IoTShield uses clustering and anomaly detection machine learning algorithms to learn normal network behavior and identify anomalies or security threats.
